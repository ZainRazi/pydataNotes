numpy broadcasting, if you add array and int, int is broadcasted to match shape of array

np array work by keeping your data in one blob opposed to pointers 
any operations occur on the blob just interprets in a different way. do not need to write to new memory locations etc

y.__array_interface__ : dumps out np objects info
as you manipulate it data will not change but shape will etc


strides = how far you need to go to next element ie ( 8, 8) move 8 bytes (one number) to get next across and down

(8,16) would move 8 bytes across then 16 down, probably accessing garbage data

einsum useful library but has its own syntax, sometimes faster than operating directly, but doesnâ€™t need to create a copy, for some operations saves memory




mixins: overriding __array_ufunc__ allows you to change behaviour of np.add, np.subtract etc


ln 16-18 if argument passed in, ie array to add to original, if type is not this class raise error
