demystifying pandas internals

slow down comes from types in data frame, memory loading is the biggest overhead

DF(dtype = Object) is much slower than DF(dtype = float)
all of this is from the extra loading needed for Object, need to get object then check the pointer to value


DF has something called blockmanager accessed through df._data, manages different data types in one DF
	each block is a numpy array 

DF memory stored in columns, thats why operations on columns is fast but operation on rows is slow


DF view copy error
	some operations make a view of DF to operate on, this error is thrown when you attempt to change view but not necessarily the real DF

BlockManager is being looked at to replace

DF has no native support of string, has to be stored as object
