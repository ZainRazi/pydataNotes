using human classification (through the zooniverse website) and ML learning model together is better than either separately. Effectively you can use human classification to separate a large chunk of the data set, and focus on models data within that area.

using drop out to make one neural net really a collection of many neural nets, and you are essentially taking average

bayesian nueral networks

at testing time pass through neural network (forward) many times. This will give us different values which we can use to create confidence intervals
